I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Digital Futures, where I work with Prof. Giuseppe Belgioioso and Prof. Mikael Johansson. I received my Ph.D. in Robotics, Control, and Intelligent Systems from EPFL in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate, Prof. John Lygeros, and Prof. Florian DÃ¶rfler. During my doctoral studies, I was affiliated with the NCCR Automation. Before that, I obtained a B.Sc. in Information Engineering and two M.Sc. degrees in Automation Engineering and Automatic Control and Robotics from the University of Padova and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia through the TIME double degree program. My research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, optimization, and machine learning. I was awarded the Digital Futures Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2025.
